# Paper-Spigot-Dev-Enviroment
Automatically download and update your paper spigot builds. If there is a new build available, this script will automatically update to the last paper spigot build after selecting your desired Minecraft version. In addition, it will automatically copy the eula.txt and all plugins from the global plugin folder, and reset it after each start.
